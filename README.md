Main class represents the main activity of the application. It sets up the UI elements like ListView, EditText, and Buttons. It also handles the logic for adding tasks, loading tasks from SharedPreferences, and displaying the EditTaskDialog when a task is clicked.
Task Adapter class extends BaseAdapter and is responsible for populating the ListView with tasks. It provides the necessary methods to manage the task data and update the UI accordingly.
EditTaskDialogclass represents a custom dialog for editing tasks. It receives the task to be edited, the list of tasks, the adapter for the ListView, and a function to save the updated task list. It allows users to update the task name and delete tasks.

These implementations work together to create a task management application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. The MainActivity serves as the entry point, the TaskAdapter handles the ListView population, and the EditTaskDialog provides a user interface for task editing.
